## **Key Projects**

### EAS-503 Project: Insurance Renewal Prediction
**Objective:** This project builds an end-to-end Air Quality Prediction system starting with data normalization and exploratory analysis then running multiple experiments to find the best model.Finally we containerize and deploy the chosen model with FastAPI allowing real-time predictions

#### **Dataset:**
- Utilized an Air Quality and Pollution Assessment <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mujtabamatin/air-quality-and-pollution-assessment" target="_blank">dataset</a>
 which captures critical environmental and demographic factors that influence pollution levels.

#### **Approach:**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and built machine learning pipelines for multiple algorithms.
- Logged experimental metrics in DagsHub using MLflow.

#### **Experiments:**
1. **Experiment 1:** Logistic Regression.
2. **Experiment 2:** Random Forest.
3. **Experiment 3:** Feature Engineering.
4. **Experiment 4:** Feature Selection.
5. **Experiment 5:** PCA Dimensionality Reduction.
6. **Experiment 6:** GradientBoostingClassifier (Best Model).
7. **Experiment 7:** LightGBMClassifier.

#### **Deployment:**
- Hosted the best model pipeline using FastAPI on DigitalOcean.
- Developed a Streamlit app connecting to the pipeline for real-time air quality predictions.
